Using a mobile sales dataset, I was able to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that brought the data to life.
This project has helped me immensely in understanding the real-world application of data visualization and analytics.
I learnt how to analyze sales trends, track performance metrics, and identify key business insights.
It reinforced the importance of clear data presentation for driving informed decision-making.
